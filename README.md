# Multy Agent Generative System - Digital Twin for Flotation Process

## Introduction
This project implements a **Digital Twin** for a mining flotation process, integrating **AI agent Advisor** for real-time monitoring and decision-making. The system consists of a Python-based simulator, an AI-powered analytical engine, and a React-based dashboard for data visualization.

## Background: Digital Twin, AI Agent Advisor, and Mining Flotation Process

### Digital Twin
A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of the flotation process that continuously updates with real-time data.

### AI Agent Advisor
The AI Agent Advisor serves as a continuous expert, delivering in-depth analysis of recommendations and system performance while assisting users in interpreting complex data in real time.

### Mining Flotation Process
Flotation is a mineral processing method that separates valuable minerals from ore based on their hydrophobic properties. The process involves:
- Feeding crushed ore into flotation tanks
- Adding air and reagents to create bubbles
- Attaching hydrophobic minerals to bubbles and separating them from hydrophilic materials
- Recovering the concentrate for further refinement

## Implementation

### Python Simulation (Back-end)
The **Digital Twin Flotation Process Simulator** (see `Digital_Twin_Flotation_Process.py`) generates synthetic process data, including:
- **Feed Rate (tph)**: Ore input per hour
- **Air Flow (mÂ³/min)**: Air supply to flotation cells
- **pH Level**: Acidity/alkalinity of the flotation environment
- **Recovery Rate (%)**: Efficiency of valuable mineral separation
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies process deviations. This feature is not visible to the AI Agent Advisor.

The simulator runs continuously and provides real-time data via a **FastAPI** server, accessible at `http://localhost:8000/data`.

### Dashboard (Front-end)
The **dashboard (App.js)** visualizes flotation process metrics using **Chart.js** and provides AI-driven insights. Features include:
- Real-time plotting of recovery rate, feed rate, air flow, and pH level
- Anomaly markers for process deviations
- AI-generated insights on system performance

### AI Agent Advisor
The AI agent in **React (App.js)** monitors incoming data and triggers **Google Gemini AI** once a threshold of new data points is reached. The AI Agent Advisor provides:
- Summary Statistics
- Potential Factors Influencing Recovery Rate Fluctuations
- Recommendations for Further Investigations

The AI-generated reports are displayed in markdown format within the dashboard.
